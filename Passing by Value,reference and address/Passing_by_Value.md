# Passing By Value
The call/Pass by value method of passing arguments to a function copies are the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function.
<p>
In this case chnages made to a parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument. 
</p>
<p>
By Default , C++ uses call by value to pass arguments. In general , this means thatcode within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function. 
</p>

# Passing by reference
The pass by reference method of passing arguments to a function copies the refrence of an arguement into the formal parameters.
<p>
Inside the function , the reference is used to access the actual argument use din the call . This means that changes made to a parameter affect the passed arguments.
</p>

<p>
To pass the value by reference , argument reference is passed to the functions just like any other value. 
</p>

# Passing By Address
The call by pointer method of passing to a function copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter.

<p>
Inside the function , the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call.This means that changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument.
</p>

<p>
To pass the value by pointer , argument pointers are passed to the functions just like any other value.
